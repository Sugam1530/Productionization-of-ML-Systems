        "\n",
        "This project focuses on building a **Hotel Recommendation System** using collaborative filtering techniques and deploying it as an interactive web application through **Streamlit** and **ngrok**. The project was developed in **Google Colab** and leverages **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** from the **Surprise** library to generate personalized hotel recommendations for users based on historical data.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Key Features:\n",
        "1. **Dataset Preparation:**\n",
        "   - The dataset used contains columns such as `userCode`, `name`, `place`, `days`, `price`, `total`, `day_of_week`, and `month`.\n",
        "   - Basic **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and feature engineering were performed to clean and prepare the data for model training.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Collaborative Filtering with SVD:**\n",
        "   - **SVD** (Singular Value Decomposition), a popular collaborative filtering algorithm, was used to generate personalized hotel recommendations.\n",
        "   - The model was trained to predict user preferences for different hotels based on past interactions, considering factors such as `userCode` and `place`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Streamlit Web Application:**\n",
        "   - The recommendation system was integrated into a **Streamlit** web application for easy interaction and visualization.\n",
        "   - Users can input their `userCode` and select a destination `place` to get hotel recommendations.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Filtering and Sorting Options:**\n",
        "   - Additional functionality was added to allow users to filter hotels by price range and sort the recommendations by price (either from low to high or high to low).\n",
        "   - This enhanced the user experience by providing more control over the results.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Deployment with ngrok:**\n",
        "   - The web application was deployed using **ngrok**, which exposes the local Streamlit app to the internet, making it accessible via a public URL.\n",
        "   - This approach allowed seamless deployment and testing directly from Google Colab.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **User-Friendly Interface:**\n",
        "   - The app provides a simple and intuitive interface for selecting destination places, entering user codes, and applying filters.\n",
        "   - Results are displayed in a clear and concise format, allowing users to easily find relevant hotels based on their preferences.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Project Outcomes:\n",
        "- The project successfully implemented a **collaborative filtering-based recommendation system** that provides personalized hotel recommendations.\n",
        "- By integrating **Streamlit** with **ngrok**, the project demonstrates a practical approach to deploying data science models as interactive web applications directly from Google Colab.\n",
        "- The addition of filtering and sorting features further enhances the utility of the system, making it adaptable to real-world scenarios.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project showcases the application of machine learning techniques to the travel and tourism industry, offering personalized recommendations in an accessible and user-friendly format."

By leveraging Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), the system was able to generate accurate predictions based on users' past interactions with hotels.\n",

The user-friendly interface, combined with the added features of filtering and sorting, makes the application versatile and adaptable to different user needs.\n",
